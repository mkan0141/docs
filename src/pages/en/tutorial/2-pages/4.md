## Add content to your frontmatter in JavaScript

1. Add the following JavaScript to your frontmatter, between the **code fences**:

      (You can customize the code for yourself, but this tutorial will use the following example.)

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro" ins={7-12, 14}
    ---
    const pageTitle = "About Me"
    const happy = true
    const finished = false
    const goal = 3

    const identity = {
      firstName: "Sarah",
      country: "Canada",
      occupation: "Technical Writer",
      hobbies: ["photography", "birdwatching", "baseball"],
    }

    const skills = ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "React", "Astro", "Writing Docs"]
    ---
    ```

2. Then, add the following code to your HTML template, below your existing content:

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro"
    <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
      <li>I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.</li>
      {identity.hobbies.length >= 2 && 
        <li>Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}</li>
      } 
    </ul>
    <p>My skills are:<p>
    <ul>
      {skills.map((skill) => <li>{skill}</li>)}
    </ul>
    ```
:::note[Takeaways]
1. The Astro template body is written in HTML, but may also include JavaScript and JSX-like expressions.
2. The Astro frontmatter script contains only JavaScript. 
3. You can use all modern Javascript **logical operators**, **expressions** and **functions** in either section of your `.astro` file. But, curly braces are necessary (only) in the HTML template body.

## Styling an Individual Page

Using Astro's own `<style></style>` tags, you can style items on your page. Adding **attributes** and **directives** to these tags gives you even more ways to style.

1. Copy the following code and paste it into `src/pages/about.astro` immediately after the code fence, before the `<html>` tag:

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro"
   
    <style>
      h1 {
        color: purple;
      }
    </style>
    ```

    Check all three pages in your browser preview. Which color is the page title of:

    - your Home page?  || _black_ ||
    - your About page? || _purple_ ||
    - your Blog page? || _black_ ||

    :::tip
    If you are unable to determine colors visually, you can use the dev tools in your browser to inspect the `<h1>` title elements and verify the text color applied.
    :::

2. Add the following code to your existing style tag:

     ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro" ins={5-8}
    <style>
      h1 {
        color: purple;
      }
      .skill {
        color: green;
        font-weight: bold;
      }
    </style>
    ```

3. Update the list of skills on your About page by adding the class name `skill` to the generated `<li>` element. Your code should now look like this:

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro" 'class="skill"'
    <p>My skills are:<p>
    <ul>
      {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
    </ul>
    ```

  4. Visit your About page in your browser again, and verify, through visual inspection or through dev tools, that each item in your list of skills is now green and bold.

## CSS Variables
The Astro `<style>` tag can also reference any variables from your frontmatter script using the `define:vars={...}` directive. You can **define variables within your code fence**, then **use them as CSS variables in your style tag**.

1. Add the following code into the frontmatter script of `src/pages/about.astro`

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro"
    ---
    const skillColor = "green"
    ---
    ```

2. Update your existing `<style>` tag below to first define, then use this `skillColor` variable.

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro" "define:vars={{skillColor}}" "var(--skillColor)" del={6} ins={7}
    <style define:vars={{skillColor}}>
      h1 {
        color: purple;
      }
      .skill {
        color: green;
        color: var(--skillColor);
        font-weight: bold;
      }
    </style>
    ```

3. Check your About page in your browser preview, and and once again, you should not notice any changes! The color green is still being applied, but now through the `define:vars` directive.

## Try it Yourself!
 
 1. Update the `<style>` tag on your About page so that it matches the one below. 

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro"
    <style define:vars={{skillColor, fontWeight, textCase, bulletStyle}}>
      h1 {
        color: purple;
      }
      .skill {
        color: var(--skillColor);
        font-weight: var(--fontWeight);
        text-transform: var(--textCase);
      }
      ul li::marker {
        content: var(--bulletStyle);
      }
    </style>
    ```
 
 2. Add any missing variable definitions in your frontmatter script so that your new `<style>` tag successfully applies these styles to your list of skills:
 - the text color is green
 - the text is bold
 - the list items are in all-caps (all uppercase letters)
 - the list bullets are asterisks (*)


<details>
<summary>Show me the code!</summary>

```astro title="src/pages/about.astro"
---
const skillColor = "green"
const fontWeight = "bold"
const textCase = "uppercase"
const bulletStyle = "'*'"
---
```
</details>

## Global Styles
You have seen that the Astro `<style>` tag is **scoped by default**, meaning that it only affects the elements in its own file.

There are a few ways to define styles **globally** in Astro, but in this tutorial, you will create and import a `global.css` file into each of your pages. This combination of stylesheet and `<style>` tag gives you the ability to control some styles site-wide, and to apply some specific styles exactly where you want them.

1. Create a new file at the location `src/styles/global.css` (You'll have to create a `styles` folder first.)

2. Copy the following code into your new file, `global.css`

    ```css title="src/styles/global.css"
    html {
      background-color: #00539F;
    }
    body {
      background-color: #E2CAF1;
      margin: 0 auto;
      width: 80%;
      max-width: 80ch;
      padding: 1em;
      border: 5px solid black;
    }

    h1 {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 20px 0;
      color: #00539F;
      text-shadow: 3px 3px 1px grey;
    }
    ```
3. In `about.astro`, add the following import statment anywhere in your frontmatter: 

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro" ins={2}
    ---
    import '../styles/global.css'
    ---
    ```

4. Check the browser preview of your About page, and you should now see new styles applied!

## Try it Yourself
Add the necessary line of code to each `.astro` file in your project to apply your global styles to every page of your site.

<details>
<summary>Show me the code!</summary>

Add the following import statement to the two other page files: `src/pages/index.astro` and `src/pages/blog.astro`

```astro
---
// src/pages/index.astro
import '../styles/global.css'
---
```
</details>

Make any changes or additions you want to the content of your About page by adding HTML elements to the page template, either statically or dynamically. Write any additional JavaScript in your frontmatter script to provide you with values to use in your HTML. When you are happy with this page, commit your changes to GitHub before moving on to the next lesson.

### Analyze the Pattern
Your About page is now styled using *both* the imported `global.css` file *and* a `<style>` tag.

- Are styles from both styling methods being applied? 

    || Yes ||

- Are there any conflicting styles, and if so, which are applied?

    || Yes, `h1` is defined as blue globally, but purple locally in the `<style>` tag. The purple color is applied.  ||

- Describe how `global.css` and `<style>` work together.

    || When conflicting styles are defined both globally and in a page's local `<script>` tag, the local styles should overwrite any global styles. (But, there can be other factors involved, so always visually inspect your site to make sure your styles are properly applied!)  ||

- How would you choose whether to declare a style in a `global.css` file or a `<style>` tag?

    || If you want a style to be applied site-wide, you would choose to use a `global.css` file. However, if you want styles to apply to only the HTML content in a single `.astro` file, and not affect other elements on your site, you would choose a `<style>` tag. ||


## Before you go

### Test your knowledge

Fill in the blanks with: **expressions** ~~ **curly braces** ~~ **objects and values** ~~ **JavaScript** 

`.astro` files have two sections: one where || **JavaScript** || is assumed, and one where you must use || **curly braces** || to tell Astro when you are writing JavaScript.

Even though plain HTML is all you need to write in your `.astro` files, Astro lets you define || **objects and values** ||, and supports all modern JavaScript logical operators, || **expressions** || and functions.

### Checklist for moving on

<Checklist key="style">
- [ ] I can define objects and arrays in my frontmatter script and use their contents in HTML elements.
- [ ] I can use the JavaScript `map()` function to produce the same HTML element for each item in an array.
- [ ] I can add CSS styles to HTML elements on a page using an Astro `<style>` tag.
- [ ] I can use variables from my frontmatter script in my CSS to style elements on the page.
- [ ] I can define global CSS styles in a `.css` file located elsewhere in my project, and I understand how they work with local `<style>` tags.
</Checklist>
