Now that you have a working site on the web, let's add pages and posts!

## Where are we now?

Here's a working version of the code at this point in the tutorial. Compare to your own local progress, or click to open in another window and start coding along in your browser from here.

## Where are we going?

<Goals>

  - created new Astro pages (About, Blog)
  - added three blogs post in Markdown
  - styled your About page using Astro's `<style>` tags
</Goals>

 In this unit, you will write code in the **two sections of a `.astro` file** and see how they work together to create the content for a page on your website. 
 
 You'll also add blog posts written as Markdown (`.md`) files with YAML frontmatter. 
 
 So let's add some new pages! All it takes is adding new `.astro` or `.md` files to your project in the right place.

<!-- ### Anatomy of an Astro file

<!-- Astro Template (body) -->  
<!-- Written in Astro (HTML with additional JSX-like features) -->
<!-- contains HTML elements, components, JX/JSX espressions -->
