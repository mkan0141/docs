## Edit your page

1. In VS Code, navigate in the Explorer file pane to `src/pages/index.astro` and click on it to open the file's contents in an editable tab.

    The contents of your `index.astro` file should look like this:

    ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
    ---
    ---

    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <link rel="icon" type ="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.ico" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
        <meta name="generator" content = {Astro.generator} >
        <title>Astro</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Astro</h1>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

2. Edit the content of your page `<body>`.

Type in the editor to change the the heading text on your page and save the change.

    ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" del={2} ins={3}
    <body>
      <h1>Astro</h1>
      <h1>My Astro Site</h1>
    </body>
    ```

3. Check the browser preview and you should see your page content updated to the new text.

That's it! Now you are ready to make and see changes to your code and build your Astro website.

:::note[customize your view]
Your code editor has many screen sections available to you all at once. You may want to resize these panes to make the terminal smaller (you won't use it often while running in dev mode) or to minimize your list of files to give you the most area for your code.
